<!-- The hero and the shot plate share one sky. The white ground and the
     painted cloud plate used to live inside the hero, which put a hard seam
     across the page wherever the hero ended; they belong to the pair, so they
     sit on the wrapper and both sections ride on top of them. -->
<div class="atmos">
  <div class="atmos__ground"></div>
  <!-- The film is the ground the rest of the weather sits on: it is the first
       layer after the white plate, so the clouds, the fluid field and the grain
       all run over it in the order they always did.

       Currently dormant: it ships with no source and preload="none", and the
       one script that would attach data-src - heroVideo.js - is commented out
       in components/SiteBody.tsx at the studio's request, so this element
       fetches nothing and the white ground below is what shows. The element
       stays so turning the film back on is a one-line change there. -->

  <!-- The crown draws itself on: one stroke, run as a dash offset, used as a

       fading in. The mask stroke is deliberately fatter than the tube, so the
       finished copy (.crown-draw__full) settles in underneath at the end to
       guarantee every tip and outer bend is covered. Both <image>s point at
       the same file, which is the transparent-background crown the hero
       already used - the source animation carried its own painted backdrop
       and that is exactly what has been dropped here. -->

         .liquid (parallax) and .liquid__inner (the float loop, which carries
         the mark's 12deg resting tilt) are both written every frame by
         main.js; putting the intro on either would mean fighting it, and
         putting it further in would mean translating along the tilted axes. -->

          <defs>
            <mask id="crownDraw" maskUnits="userSpaceOnUse" x="0" y="0" width="900" height="625">
              <rect width="900" height="625" fill="#000"/>
              <!-- Authored against a square 1254 board; this transform lands it
                   on the tightly-cropped 900x625 artwork (fitted to the crown's
                   own alpha, mean coverage .84 along the centreline).
                   The width is measured, not eyeballed: the path is a smooth
                   bezier and it cuts the corners, so at every sharp bend the
                   tube's outer edge sits further from the centreline than the
                   stroke reaches. At 115 that left 1.3% of the artwork behind
                   as white nicks along the outer bends, which stayed on screen
                   until the clean copy settled. 142 covers 99.91%.
                   The caps are BUTT, not round. A round cap paints a disc of
                   half the stroke width even where the dash has zero length,
                   and the dash sits at zero length on the path's last point
                   for the whole draw - so a 71-unit disc of artwork was being
                   revealed at 336,832, which lands on the tip of the left
                   spike's tail. That showed as a loose droplet beside the
                   mark from before the draw even started. Measured at the
                   first frame: 14,414 stray pixels with round, 31 with butt,
                   and butt covers more of the artwork at full draw, not
                   less.

                   The black below it is the other half of the fix. Reversing
                   the draw put the tail's tip at the START of the stroke,
                   where it is attached from frame one - but it moved the same
                   fault to the other end. The path's opening point is the
                   swoosh's own tip, now the last thing drawn, and the swoosh's
                   curl passes that tip's artwork at 29.5px on the way round
                   while the brush reaches 64. So from about three quarters of
                   the way through, a sliver of the tip sat loose below the
                   mark until the line finally arrived: the droplet again, on
                   the other side. No brush width fixes that one - it would
                   have to drop under 56 to clear 29.5px, and at 56 it no
                   longer covers the tube it is tracing. Measured both ends the
                   same way: the tail's tip has 48.3px of clearance and the
                   swoosh's has 29.5px, so direction alone can only ever
                   rescue one of them.
                   Hence the mask paints black back over the stretch the
                   stroke has not reached yet, and retreats in step with it -
                   88 wide, which covers that tube whole and stays well inside
                   the 58.6px at which any other part of the path comes near
                   it, so it cannot bite a neighbouring strand.

                   "M 813.33 922.40 L 790 928" is a 24-unit lead-in along the
                   start tangent, and it replaces a black disc that used to
                   sit at the path's end. The artwork's tip does not stop
                   where the path stopped: walking the alpha out from the end
                   point, ink runs a further 21 units, and a butt cap paints
                   nothing past the final point, so the stroke could never
                   reach it. The disc hid that ink until the last moment.
                   That disc was the ending fault. It could not lift early -
                   the ink under it only joins the body of the mark at 2550ms
                   of 2600 - and it could not fade, because a half-faded
                   black cap is a half-transparent crown. So it stepped off
                   whole: 811px, 45x25 units, 5% of the crown's width, in a
                   single frame, after 160ms in which the fat brush and the
                   ease-out between them revealed 10 new pixels. The draw
                   stopped, and then the tip was simply there.
                   The lead-in removes the cause instead of covering it. The
                   stroke sweeps the overhang like any other part of the
                   mark, so the tip is drawn on rather than uncovered, and
                   nothing has to be held back for it. Measured over the
                   whole draw: 0 loose pixels at every frame, 0 pixels lost
                   against the old mask, the same 143273 covered at the end,
                   and a last second that tapers +842, +498, +220, +38
                   instead of stalling and then dumping.
                   24 is the number to re-measure if the artwork changes. It
                   is bounded on both sides: shorter and the far end of the
                   overhang is still loose (141px at 12 units), longer and
                   the lead-in leaves the tube. -->

<!-- Sits between the services index and the process timeline: the reader has
     just been told what the studio does, so this is where they get to see it
     rather than read on.

     The film is the same 26 MB cut the work page uses, and it carries
     preload="none" for the same reason - the cover is a real <button>, and
     nothing is fetched until somebody asks for it. So the section costs a few
     kilobytes of markup until it is wanted, which is what lets it sit this
     high on the home page at all.

     The frame opens rather than fades. It rides the same [data-rise] observer
     as the rest of the page, so there is no second IntersectionObserver here;
     the class arrives the same way, and the stylesheet reads it differently. -->

<!-- Teaser for /services/seo. Deliberately NOT built on .pack: main.js claims
     every .pack on the page for its one-open-at-a-time accordion, so a second
     group of them would make these cards fight the retainer cards above. These
     are flat, always-open cards instead, and need no script. -->

     does not ask for it; booking.js fills it on first open. Everything that
     opens this is a real link to /contact#book underneath, so without JS, on
     middle-click and for crawlers the page is still the answer. -->
